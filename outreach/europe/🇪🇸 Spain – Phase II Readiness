## 🌐 Language and Regional Considerations (2025)

Spain’s primary official language is **Spanish (Castilian)**. However, the following co-official languages are recognized in specific regions and may influence public health communication or compliance localization:

| Language     | Region(s)                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Spanish (Castilian)** | All regions (national official language) |
| **Catalan**             | Catalonia, Valencia, Balearic Islands |
| **Galician**            | Galicia |
| **Basque (Euskara)**    | Basque Country, Navarre |
| **Aranese (Occitan)**   | Val d'Aran (Catalonia) |

🔁 Multilingual adaptation may be considered for public dashboards or compliance reports in high-priority regions (Catalonia, Basque Country).
