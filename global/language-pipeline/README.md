## 📌 Purpose

This folder tracks all planned and in-progress multilingual support across global deployments of ShuddhiCheck AI. Our goal is to ensure every frontline health worker can use the platform in their **native language**, with culturally sensitive prompts, right-to-left or Unicode-safe rendering, and localized compliance vocabulary.
