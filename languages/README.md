# 🌐 ShuddhiCheck AI – Multilingual Language Support

This directory contains all language files for ShuddhiCheck AI's global dashboard interface, structured by language code folders.

Each folder includes translated `.json` files that power our AI compliance dashboard UI, forms, and alerts for international users.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder contains:
- `dashboard.json` → Core UI text for compliance dashboard

---

## 📌 Key Guidelines

- All files use **snake_case keys** (e.g., `compliance_status`)
- Keys must be consistent across all languages
- Do **not** translate keys — only the values
